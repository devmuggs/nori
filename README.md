# Nori (のり)

Nori is a free and open-source translation management system designed to help developers and translators collaborate on localisation projects. It provides a simple and efficient way to manage translations for software applications, websites, and other digital content.

## Why Nori?

Nori is a fundamental part of many types of Japanese cuisine, used to wrap (maku) various ingredients to create delicious dishes.
